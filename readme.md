# Agentic Software Analysis Workbench

This project is an **agentic workflow for automated software requirements analysis and documentation generation**. It leverages LangGraph, LangChain, and Google Gemini LLMs to generate, critique, and refine software artifacts such as Functional Requirements, Use Cases, Class Diagrams, and Activity Diagrams, all in a self-correcting, iterative workflow.

## Features

- **Automated Functional Requirements Generation:**  
  Converts a project description into a structured, testable Functional Requirements Document (FRD).

- **Self-Correcting Loops:**  
  Each artifact (FRD, Class Diagram) is critiqued by an LLM agent and revised until approved or a revision limit is reached.

- **Class & Use Case Extraction:**  
  Identifies classes, attributes, methods, and generates PlantUML diagrams and detailed use cases.

- **Activity Diagram Generation:**  
  Produces high-level workflow diagrams from requirements and class context.

- **Automated Documentation Writing:**  
  All generated artifacts and diagrams are written to a structured output directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
- [langchain-google-genai](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/google_genai)
- [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
- [IPython](https://ipython.org/)
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) (for diagram rendering, optional)

Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```sh
pip install langgraph langchain langchain-google-genai pydantic ipython
```

## Setup

1. **API Keys:**  
   - Add your Google Gemini API key and other required keys to a `.env` file in the project root.  
   - Example:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
     ```

2. **Run the Notebook:**  
   - Open `softwareAnalysis.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.
   - Execute the cells to generate and critique software artifacts for your project description.

## Usage

1. **Edit the Project Description:**  
   - Modify the `project_description` variable in the notebook to describe your software system.

2. **Run the Analysis:**  
   - Execute the notebook cells.  
   - The workflow will generate, critique, and refine all artifacts, saving them to the `ProjectStructure/` directory.

3. **View Outputs:**  
   - Generated Markdown documents and PlantUML diagrams can be found in the output directory.

## Customization

- **Prompts:**  
  You can customize the prompts for each agent (requirements, class, use case, activity diagram) in the notebook to fit your domain or standards.

- **LLM Model:**  
  The default is Google Gemini (`models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite`). You can change the model in the notebook as needed.

## Limitations

- The quality of generated artifacts depends on the LLM and prompt engineering.
- PlantUML diagrams are generated as text files; rendering requires PlantUML or compatible tools.
- Revision loops are capped to avoid infinite cycles.
